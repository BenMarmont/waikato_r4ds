# Week 01

This week I will introduce myself, give a short introduction to the course, and we will be discussing chapter 1-3 of the [R4DS Book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).
The scripts we will be discussing are almost entirely [online](https://yousayr.com/ds-intro/introVis/). Alternatively there are scripts in this repository (which go beyond what we discuss in class) and a short notebook [here](https://rpubs.com/ThomasK81/introvis).

Please also note the material in the `Slides` folder.

At the end of the first day, participants should be able to find strategies to create plots like [these](https://yousayr.com/ds-intro/visChallenge/).
